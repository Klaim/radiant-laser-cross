**R.L.C.** is a Shoot-Them-Up inspired by [Radiant-Silver-Gun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiant_Silvergun) and [Ikaruga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikaruga).

It's basically a bullet hell game with a 4 colors matching system.

# Description #

I'll add more here soon, but basically, it's about firing with the right gun/color to the right ennemy/color.

Here is a short video of the player's ship control :

# Current State #

A uncomplete gameplay prototype.
It have :

  * the players ship control (with some things to fix)

It lacks

  * a lot of refactoring (I started as a 1 work-days evening week challenge, so it's not totally well thought)
  * collision system (current wip)
  * scripting system
    * level edition system
    * ennemy behaviour system
  * maybe a clearer graphics separation in the code (currently I use only colored blocks that are hardcoded).

# Why open source? #

  1. Feel free to participate to make it better - in any way.
  1. Feel free to take the code as an engine and make a good game from it.
  1. I have other bigger and less free game projects to make money from.

If you want to participate you can :
  * try the current game (if you can compile it) and enter any issues you encounter on this site
  * look at the code and point to things to enhance (use the code review system here?)
  * make some patches and send them to me (or put the in related issues)
  * build a feature (your idea or something from the [TODOLIST](http://code.google.com/p/radiant-laser-cross/source/browse/TODOLIST.txt)) in a clone repository and tell me about it once done
  * (once the scripting system is done) make some crazy levels and ennemies (bad ass bosses)
